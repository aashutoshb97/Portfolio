## About Me

Hi! I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where I am advised by [Dr. Huimin Zhao](http://faculty.scs.illinois.edu/~zhaogrp/). My research primarily focuses on developing computational tools for engineering functionally improved synthetic biology components and cellular factories. I’m particularly enthusiastic about studying evolution at various levels, including regulatory elements, proteins, organelles, and strains. My career interests lie in harnessing Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning for advancements in biology and healthcare.
