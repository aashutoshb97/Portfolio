## About Me

Hi! I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where I am advised by [Dr. Huimin Zhao](http://faculty.scs.illinois.edu/~zhaogrp/). My research primarily focuses on developing computational tools for engineering functionally improved synthetic biology components and cellular factories. Iâ€™m particularly enthusiastic about studying evolution at various levels, including regulatory elements, proteins, organelles, and strains. My career interests lie in harnessing Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning for advancements in biology and healthcare.
